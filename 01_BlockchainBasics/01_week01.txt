-Blockchain Structure-
* transactions - validate & broadcast
* transactions form a chain
* blocks - consensus process
* chosen block - verified
* miners (peer nodes) - consensus & verify

Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)
set of all utxos collectively define the state of the bitcoin blockchain
Reference Number
Input utxo -> Output utxo
utxos stored in the participant nodes

UTXO:
* unique identifier of the transaction that created the utxo
* index of this utxo in the transactions output list
* value
* optional script - conditions under which output can be spend

Transaction (Tx):
* reference number of the current transaction 
* reference(s) to one or more input utxos
* reference(s) to one or more output utxos newly generated by the current transaction
* total input amount and output amount

Genesis Block

Hash -> Previous Block

-Basic Operations-

Operations:
* validation of transactions
* gathering transactions for a block
* broadcasting valid transactions & blocks
* consensus on next block creation
* chaining blocks

Two major roles for participants:
* participants who initiate transfer of value by creating a transaction
* miners:
  ** verify transactions
  ** broadcast transactions
  ** compete to create a block
  ** reach consensus by validating block
  ** broadcast new block
  ** confirm transactions

Tranasction validation is caried out independently by all miners
more than 20 criteria including:
* valid referenced input utxo
* valid referenced output utxo
* referenced input amount and output amount match

Tx added
invalid Tx are rejected
valid Tx are added to a pool of unconfirmed Tx
miners select a set of Tx to create a block
miners compete by solving puzzle
solved block is broadcast
new block is verified
new block is added to chain and confirmed

Proof-of-Work protocol

Tx[0] - index 0 of the confirmed block:
* is created by the miner of the block
* has a special output utxo
* no input utxo
* called - Coinbase transaction (miner's fee)

-Beyond Bitcoin-
* bitcoin scripts
* ethereum - smart contracts (code execution)

Types of blockchain:
* type 1 - only cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)
* type 2 - currency + business logic (Ethereum)
* type 3 - only business logic (Hyperledger)

Blockchain categories:
* public (Bitcoin)
* private (within a organization)
* permissioned (consortion)
